BRAIN GAMES - This is a set of five simple games that allow you to train your mind. To try it out, all you have to do is enter the dataset package from PyPI and run one of the games on your Linux terminal. All commands for launching individual games are listed below:

    1. brain-calc - the game that asks you to find the sum, difference or product of two numbers.

    2. brain-even - the game that asks you to determine whether a number is even or not.

    3. brain-gcd - the game in which you need to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

    4. brain-prinme - the game in which you need to determine whether a number is prime.

    5. brain-progression - the game in which you need to find the missing number in the progression.
